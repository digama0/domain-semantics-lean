/-! # Lifts on de Bruijn indices

This file defines `Lift`, a compact term-level representation of the
weakening / extension transformations applied to de Bruijn indices when
crossing binders. A `Lift` is a sequence of `skip` (insert a fresh
variable) and `cons` (pin variable 0, recurse) constructors built from a
`refl` base, and is evaluated by `liftVar : Lift → Nat → Nat`.

`Lift` and its operations (`comp`, `consN`, `depth`) are the bookkeeping
device that lets every later weakening lemma (`Lookup.weak'`,
`IsDefEq.weak'`, `Ctx.Lift'`, …) be parameterised uniformly. -/

namespace DomainSemantics

/-- A *lift* is a transformation on de Bruijn indices, built from:
* `refl`: identity on indices;
* `skip l`: under-the-binder shift — bumps every index in the codomain by
  one (i.e. introduces a fresh variable);
* `cons l`: pointwise extension under one extra binder (variable `0` is
  pinned and indices `i+1` go through `l`).
Lifts compose under `comp`. `liftVar` evaluates a lift on a single index. -/

/-- `consN l k` applies `cons` to `l` exactly `k` times — i.e. pins the first
`k` variables and passes the rest through `l`. -/

  | k+1 => .cons (consN l k)

/-- Composition of lifts: `comp l₁ l₂` is the lift that first applies `l₁`
to an index and then `l₂`. The pattern-matching unfolds by *outermost*
constructor of `l₂`. -/
